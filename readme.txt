## SECTION 2 : EXECUTIVE SUMMARY / PAPER ABSTRACT
This Program is for the testing of semiconductor wafers, were we apply deep learning neural network on wafer maps with simulated faults.
The faults are classified into 8 classes and the neural network is trained to recognize them.
Being able to recognize a particular wafer fault using Deep Learning means that we could automate the identification of wafer testing, 
and reduce the time to sort out the bad wafers. Most importantly we could pin-point a specific issue with a particular upstream 
process and to rectify it.
